Vector Analyzer is a website that analyzes 2D vectors and simulate their effect in motion. The website has two 
main features: Motion Simulator and X-Y Components Calculator. The Motion Simulator uses user input to draw the 
final vector and simulate the motion on an object, simulating its acceleration. The X-Y Component Calculator 
allows the user to draw vector on a canvas, and then it calculates X and Y components of the Vector and draws 
them.

The Project was using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Processing.Js. I originally built the project to 
compete in the S.T.E.M. contest in my senior year of highschool and it won me the second place. The website mainly 
uses pythagoras theorem for calculations and Processing.Js for drawings and animation.
